                <h2>My Dearest Sahana,</h2>
                <p>I can't believe it's been a year since I first heard your voice on January 21st, 2025. From that moment, my life changed forever. Every conversation, every video call, every moment we've shared has been a blessing.</p>
                <p>From our first meeting on that cold February night when you introduced me to Chinese cuisine, to holding hands on a frozen lake, to our brave winter storm adventure, to celebrating Christmas together - every memory with you is precious beyond words.</p>
                <p>You've taught me what home feels like. When I'm with you, I don't just feel happy - I feel complete. You are my family, my best friend, and the love of my life.</p>
                <p>This website is a small token of my love for you, a place where I can share how much you mean to me and celebrate our beautiful journey together.</p>
                <p class="signature">Forever yours,<br>Prajwal ❤️</p>

We tried Chinese cuisine together, you cooked me delicious pork and idli/dosa (even with the idli cooker problems!). We walked hand-in-hand on the frozen lake, went ice skating for my first time (I'll never forget your brave spirit when you fell but didn't give up!), and did wine tasting. We fell asleep holding hands, both shy and nervous. And in the morning... our first kiss. The most beautiful moment of my life.</p>
